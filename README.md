asset-based authentication.sol file presents an AI created base code. The code includes our research we have completed where users have the ability to deposit assets into an account. We also implemented a withdrawal method. The withdrawal method will allow users to withdraw all remaining assets and return them to their account when finished with using the Authentication server. Our coding is a base set representing how we believe the remix set up would function and operate by allowing users the luxury of depositing and withdrawing assets.
